# Exercise 11.1

* When doing CI with Java there are tools for linting, testing and building. Linting can be done with the tool Checkstyle. Testing can be done  with JUnit. Building can be done with Maven, Gradle or Ant.
* Other build tools than Jenkins and GitHub Actions are Bamboo and Travis CI. Bamboo has to be downloaded and run in a self-hosted environment, while Travis Ci can only run in the cloud.
* A setup with Java, Checkstyle, JUnit and Maven could use the self-hosted Bamboo or the cloud hosted Travis CI. Both solutions are good. Bamboo has some expensive initial cost for the server and the software. Travis CI doesn't need an own server and has because of that less initial costs. Over longer times, the costs could be similar. Travis CI has some limitations of the hardware, while Bamboo can run on a server that can be setup with arbitrary hardware. For small to medium sized projects Travis CI can be a better solution, as the initial costs are low and there is no need to setup a server. For large scale projects Bamboo could be the better choice, as it can run on arbitrary hardware and can be used by many developers. So the decision of the CI tool depends on the project size.
